Django View Example:

""""""
# views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse
import datetime

def index_view(request):
    # fetch data and time
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    # convert to string
    html = "Time is {}".format(now)
    # return response
    return HttpResponse(html)
""""""

-> First, we import the class HttpResponse from the django.http module, along with Pythonâ€™s datetime library.
-> Next, we define a function called index_view. This is the view function.
-> Each view function takes an HttpRequest object as its first parameter, which is typically named request.
-> The view returns an HttpResponse object that contains the generated response. 
-> Each view function is responsible for returning an HttpResponse object.

""""""
# urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import index_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('', index_view),
]

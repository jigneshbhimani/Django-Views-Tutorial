Django Views are one of the vital participants of MVT Structure of Django.

A View function is a Python function that takes a Web request object and returns a Web response.

This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, anything that a web browser can display.

Djnago Views are part of the user interface - they usually render the HTML/CSS/JavaScript in your Template files into what you see in your browser when you render a web page.
